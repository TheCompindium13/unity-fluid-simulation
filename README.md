Real-time fluid simulation in unity.

## Features
- Based on Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics method.
- Runs entirely on GPU.
- Handles up to one million particles.
- Uses counting sort to speed-up neighbor searching.
- Implementing surface extraction techniques proposed by Yu and Turk.
- Performs normal smoothing to make the surface more realistic while avoiding expensive isosurface extraction algorithms.
- Basic water shading
